## Explanation 1

This will take O(N) time. The fact that we iterate through the array twice doesn't matter.

## Explanation 2

The inner for loop has O(N) iterations and it is called N times. Therefore, the runtime is O(N<sup>2</sup>).

Another way we can see this is by inspecting what the "meaning" of the code is. It is printing all pairs (twoÂ­
element sequences). There are O(N<sup>2</sup>) pairs; therefore, the runtime is O(N<sup>2</sup>).

## Explanation 3

Array Length is 4 (so i goes 0-3)

i = 0 -> j = 1,2,3 // i = 1 -> j = 2,3 // i = 2 -> j = 3 // i = 3 -> j = no-loop 

So each iteration of `i` goes through --> `N-1, N-2, ...3, 2, 1` which is `((N-1)*N)/2` = O(N<sup>2</sup>)

## Explanation 4

For each element ofarrayA, the inner for loop goes throughb iterations, where `b = arrayB.length`. lf `a = arrayA.length`,then the runtime is `O(ab)`.

If you said O(N<sup>2</sup>), then remember your mistake for the future. It's not O(N<sup>2</sup>) because there are two different inputs. Both matter. This is an extremely common mistake.

## Explanation 5

Still `O(ab)` as the third loop is constant time. 

## Explanation 6

This algorithm runs in `O(N)` time. The fact that it only goes through half of the array (in terms of iterations) does not impact the big O time.

## Explanation 7

- If `P < N/2`,then we know that N is the dominant term so we can drop the `O(P)`
- `O(2N)` is `O(N)` since we drop constants.
- `O(N)` dominates `O(log N)`,so we can drop the `O(log N)`.
- There is no established relationship between N and M, so we have to keep both variables in there.

Therefore,all but the last one are equivalent to `O(N)`.

## Explanation 8

Ideally one will say O(N<sup>2</sup>(log N)) - but because of length of array != largest string in array, we can't use `N` at all. 

- Let `s` be the length of the longest string.
- Let `a` be the length of the array.

How to come to solution: 
- Sorting each string is O(s log s)
- We have to do this for every string (and there are `a` strings), so that's `O(a*s log s)`
- Now we have to sort all the strings. There are `a` strings,so you'll may be inclined to say that this takes `O(a log a)` time. This is what most candidates would say. You should also take into account that you need to compare the strings. Each string comparison takes `O(s)` time.There are `O(a log a)` comparisons, therefore this will take `O(a*s log a)` time

If you add up these two parts, you get `O(a*s(log a + log s))`

## Explanation 9

_Simple_ approach each node of the tree is visited once, so it is `O(N)`.

_Recursion_ approach it is discussed that the runtime of a recursive function with multiple branches is typically O(branches<sup>depth</sup>). There are two branches at each call, so we're looking at O(2<sup>depth</sup>).

What is depth? The tree is a balanced binary search tree. Therefore, if there are `N` total nodes, then depth is roughly `log N`. Which gives us O(2<sup>log N</sup>)

Which can be simplified if P = 2<sup>log N</sup> this means P = N

## Explanation 10

The `for` loop will start when i = 2 and end when `x*x = n`. Or,in other words,it stops when x=\sqrt{n} (when x equals the square root of n).

Hence it is O(\sqrt{n})
